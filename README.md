# PAL-IN
A simple React + TypeScript demo for loading and saving pallet projects.

The React application lives in the `pal-in/` directory.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
cd pal-in
npm install
```

## Development

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Run the unit tests verifying JSON import/export logic:

```bash
npm test
```

## Build

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```


## Example Project

A sample pallet project JSON is provided in `examples/sample-project.json`. Load this file in the demo application to quickly verify that loading and saving work.
