# PAL-IN
A simple React + TypeScript demo for loading and saving pallet projects.

The React application lives in the `pal-in/` directory.

This project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) via the CDN build
included in `pal-in/index.html`. No local Tailwind tooling is required.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
cd pal-in
npm install
```

## Development

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Build

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```
